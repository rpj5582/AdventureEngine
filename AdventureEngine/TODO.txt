IDEAS:
-Shadows
-Deferred rendering
-Day and night cycle
-Physics

BUSY WORK:
-Add mouse movement in the input class
-Make Shader class a resource
-Separate Texture class into Texture, Cubemap, and Texture Atlas
-Upload fog density and gradient as uniforms
-Upload camera near and far planes as uniforms
-Separate AssetManager into multiple asset managers, and have one master AssetManager that controls them all

BUGS:
-Alpha blending is bugged

OPTIMIZATIONS:
-Draw objects that use the same textures and models in order (Order object lists to maximize efficiency)
-Use object and component arrays for iteration rather than arrays of pointers for cache optimization
