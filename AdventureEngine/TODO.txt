IDEAS:
-Shadows
-Deferred rendering
-Day and night cycle
-Audio

BUSY WORK:
-Make Shader class a resource
-Separate Texture class into Texture, Cubemap, and Texture Atlas
-Make classes final?
-Upload fog density and gradient as uniforms
-Upload camera near and far planes as uniforms
-Separate AssetManager into multiple asset managers, and have one master AssetManager that controls them all

BUGS:
-Alpha blending is bugged

OPTIMIZATIONS:
-Draw objects that use the same textures and models in order
